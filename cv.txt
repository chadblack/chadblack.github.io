# Publications    

*Limits of Gender Domination: Women, Law, and Political Crisis in Quito, 1765-1830*. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2010.  


Through analysis of extensive civil and criminal litigation, this book
documents impressive economic, legal, and social rights customarily
exercised by women of the *corregimiento* of Quito during the closing
decades of Bourbon rule. Following the cultural logic of decentralism
and negotiated consent, women were able to mitigate attempts by the
centralizing Bourbon state to control their bodies and discourage access
to legal resources. The narrative then analyzes the subsequent
dismantling of customary legal rights with the emergence of a stricter,
more hierarchical gender regime with the shift to a contract society
through Ecuador's experience of the Atlantic liberal revolution. On a
scholarly level, the book represents a significant revision of
late-colonial and early republican gender history. It is also filled
with compelling human stories drawn from the litigation pursued in the
barrios of Quito.

# Works in Progress and Other Research Activities

*Quito encarcelado/Quito jailed*. A web-based database of 18th century
detainees in the jails of the Audiencia of Quito, together with
analytical essays and visualizations.

*The Politics of Intimacy in the Spanish Empire*. Active book and
research project on the relationship between sexuality, punishment, and
economic rationality in the age of Charles III (1759-1788). This project
changes the way we analyze sexuality in the Spanish empire and
understand its relationship to imperial rule under Spain’s
eighteenth-century Bourbon dynasty. How do we theorize and substantiate
popular sexual desire in the early-modern period? What role did
controlling sexual activity play in the statecraft of early-modern
Empire? In the period between 1760 and 1790, the Spanish imperial state
in the Audiencia of Quito made dramatic new claims to control the sexual
behaviors of its subjects. Royal authorities increasingly encroached on
the traditional ecclesiastical territory of pastoral surveillance and
moral correction. In the process, the state worked to conform sexual
activities to the Bourbon Monarchy's dream of a centralized,
patriarchal, economically rational absolutism. Criminal prosecutions of
illicit sexual behavior revealed the extent to which the sexual
expectations of royal authorities diverged from popular practices. As
such, the case files that preserve those prosecutions provide access to
popular cultural values that diverged from church and state dictates,
but were very rarely explicitly articulated. This project demonstrates
that the effective criminalization of extramarital sex during the
imperial reign of Charles III (1759-1788) turned non-marital sexual
relationships into contested territory, upon which the empire sought to
project its expansive claims to political and moral authority. Thus, my
research works along parallel tracks to document the ways that the
imperial state sought to buttress its authority through the control of
sexual practices, while using the paper trail produced by this endeavor
to analyze eighteenth-century sexualities. By situating popular sexual
practices as normative, instead of reactive to elite notions of honor,
this study offers a new kind of history of intimacy in the Spanish
empire. Likewise, by focusing on the control extramarital sex, it offers
a new history kind of Bourbon colonialism.

*Prescott’s Atlantic*. Active research project on the life and writings
of William Hickling Prescott, the United States’ first internationally
famous historian. Prescott created the discipline of imperial history in
the United States with his wildly popular books *The Conquest of Mexico*
(1843) and *The Conquest of Peru* (1847), works that are still in print
and read today. This project uses his life, letters, and historical
writings to provide a new narrative of the rise of historiography in the
United States, the importance of the history of Spanish American empire
to that literature, and the centrality of a transatlantic network of
consular service to its emergence. The project uses group biography and
thick descriptions of the locations of this transatlantic network of
Prescott’s interlocutors to argue that his historical methods and his
dealings with publishers place him, and the history of Spanish American
imperialism, at the inception of a new historical consciousness in the
United States. Prescott’s work established many of the defining
assumptions of Latin American historiography and the region’s place in
the American hemisphere that still hang low as a shadow over the
discipline. His appeal in the 1840s signified that the establishment of
modern historical practice in the United States was tied not only to the
ideological needs of nationalist self-definition, but also to an
expansionist colonialism aimed at Latin America, on the eve of the
Mexican-American War.
