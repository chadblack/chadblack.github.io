I am Chad Black, Associate Professor of Early Latin American History at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. I am a specialist in the colonial and early-Republican Andean region. I am especially interested in women's uses of customary legal practices to assert social and economic autonomy, the impact of the independence period on social relations, and the conflict between institutional and popular norms of sexual behaviors. I'm also interested in Spanish imperial legal culture writ large, in both its very local and its global manifestations.</p>

<p>In addition to researching and teaching, I'm an absolute fanatic for
bikepacking, rock steady, great coffee, homemade tortillas, writing seriously
simple python scripts, and the idea of having <a href="https://parezcoydigo.wordpress.com">blogged</a>.</p>  

<p>Please follow the links above to find out more about me.</p>
